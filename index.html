            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
                curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
